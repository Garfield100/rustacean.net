# rustacean.net

This is the source for [rustacean.net](http://www.rustacean.net). Includes a bunch
of Ferris the Crab / rustlang related art and assets.

## Seen a great rendition of Ferris that's not on here?

Send a pull request to add it to the `more-crabby-things` folder and add some
HTML to append it to the end of the list of related works.

(If we get too many, eventually we'll just store everything in `more-crabby things` and curate
what appears in `index.html`.)
